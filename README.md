# Car-Purchase-amount-prediction

This project presents the development of a
sophisticated data model aimed at predicting car
purchase amounts based on demographic and financial
attributes using advanced machine learning and deep
learning techniques. The analysis leverages Linear
Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Regressor, and Neural Network models to classify and
predict the purchasing power of individuals accurately.
By preprocessing the dataset to manage duplicates and
visualize distributions, the model provides insights into
key factors influencing car purchasing behaviour. The
predictiveness of these models is demonstrated by metrics
such as R-squared score (RÂ²), Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The use of
this model will have a significant influence on the
automobile sector since it provides a tool for improving
the customer experience, optimizing sales techniques, and
focusing marketing efforts. By understanding and
predicting purchasing behavior, the model enables better
resource allocation, reduces marketing costs, and
increases sales efficiency, representing a substantial
advancement in automotive market analytics.
